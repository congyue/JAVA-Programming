<h2><b>Homework 3 </b></h2>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Classes</li>
  <li>Association</li>
  <li>Javadoc</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Read chapter 4 in Core Java.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem: </h2>
<p>
  We will model a game of medieval times. Our world is filled with
  warriors and nobles. </p>
<h3>Warriors</h3>
<p>
  Warriors, despite their name, would be happy to live their lives
  quietly, if only it weren't for the need to earn a living and
  satisfy the whims of their employers, the nobles. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A warrior may be employed by only one noble at a time. He cannot be hired by a second Noble if he is already employed.</li>
  <li>He may also &quot;quit&quot;. </li>
  <li>Each warrior starts out with a name and a certain amount of
    strength.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nobles</h3>
<p>
  Nobles don't have much to do except do battle with each
  other. (We'll leave the feasting and other entertainments for
  add-ons.) Of course the nobles are pretty wimpy themselves and would
  lose if they didn't have warriors to do the dirty work. How does all
  this work?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A battle between nobles is won by the noble who commands
    the <em>stronger</em> army. </li>
  <li>
    The army's strength is simply the combined strengths of all its
    warriors.</li>
  <li>
    A battle is to the death. The losing noble is dead as are his
    warriors and the warriors lose all of their strength.</li>
  <li>
    The winner does not walk away unscathed. All of the winner's men
    will lose a portion of their strength equal to the ratio of the
    enemy army's combined strength to their army's. If the losing army
    had a combined strength that was 1/4 the size of the winning
    army's, then each soldier in the winning army will have their own
    strength reduced by 1/4.</li>
  <li>
    Even losers are allowed to pick a fight. It doesn't require having
    any strength (or life!) in order to do battle with someone
    else. Not that you stand much of a chance of winning anything, but
    perhaps it's worth getting beaten (again) just to have those 15
    seconds of fame.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>It's a sad topic, but one we do have to address:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    People die <em>when they lose</em> a battle, whether they are a
    Noble or a Warrior.</li>
  <li>
    Nobles who are dead are in no position to hire anyone.  Any
    attempt by a dead Noble to hire someone will fail and the Warrior
    will remain unhired.</li>
  <li>
    However curiously, as has been seen before, Nobles can declare
    battle even though they are dead.</li>
  <li>
    A Warrior who is dead cannot do anything. He cannot fight, cannot
    run away, cannot be hired, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Below is a sample test program and the output. As you can see you
  need to override the toString method for Noble in order for it to
  display the Noble's information. Furthermore, the battle method
  displays two lines, one reporting who is fighting and the other the
  result of the battle. Be sure to make your output match ours, in
  order to make the grader's job easier.</p>
<p>Test program:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><code>/*
	TestWarriorsNobles
*/

class TestWarriorsNobles {
    public static void  main(String[] args) {
        Noble art = new Noble("King Arthur");
        Noble lance = new Noble("Lancelot du Lac");
        Noble jim = new Noble("Jim");
        Noble linus = new Noble("Linus Torvalds");
        Noble billie = new Noble("Bill Gates");

        Warrior cheetah = new Warrior("Tarzan", 10);
        Warrior wizard = new Warrior("Merlin", 15);
        Warrior theGovernator = new Warrior("Conan", 12);
        Warrior nimoy = new Warrior("Spock", 15);
        Warrior lawless = new Warrior("Xena", 20);
        Warrior mrGreen = new Warrior("Hulk", 8);
        Warrior dylan = new Warrior("Hercules", 3);

        jim.hire(nimoy);
        lance.hire(theGovernator);
        art.hire(wizard);
        lance.hire(dylan);
        linus.hire(lawless);
        billie.hire(mrGreen);
        art.hire(cheetah);

        System.out.println(jim);
        System.out.println(lance);
        System.out.println(art);
        System.out.println(linus);
        System.out.println(billie);

        cheetah.runaway();
        System.out.println(art);

        art.battle(lance);
        jim.battle(lance);
        linus.battle(billie);
        billie.battle(lance);

	System.out.println("====================");
        System.out.println(jim);
        System.out.println(lance);
        System.out.println(art);
        System.out.println(linus);
        System.out.println(billie);
    }
}</code>

<h3>Output Description</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>toString</code> method for <code>Noble</code> lists
    information about the Noble and his army.<br />  (What's the best
    way to display each Warrior's information?)
  </li>
  <li>The runaway method displays &quot;<code>So long </code>...&quot;</li>
  <li>Each battle is reported by identifying 
    <ul>
      <li>who attacked whom.</li>
      <li>who won.
        <ul>
          <li>If both Nobles were already dead, display  <code>&quot;Oh, NO!  They're both dead!  Yuck!&quot;</code></li>
          
          <li>Else if both were alive and their armies have equal strengths, display  <code>&quot;Mutual Annihilation...&quot;</code></li>
          <li>Else if just one of them was dead, display <code>&quot;He's dead, ...&quot;</code></li>
          <li>Otherwise report who defeated whom.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>General guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Code defensively.  Is a Warrior quitting when he doesn't even have
    a job?  You don't want your code to crash, do you?  Check that
    your objects are only doing things that make sense.</li>
  <li>
    Don't make unwarranted assumptions.  E.g. can you assume that
    names are unique in this application?  Does it say so anywhere?
    Is it necessary in order to solve the problem?  Then don't!</li>
</ul>
<h3>One more thing!  Javadoc</h3>
Use javadoc-style comments in this and all subsequent assignments.
<h3>Questions?</h3>
<p>As usual, please raise them on the Discusion Board on My Poly.</p>

<h2>Homework 2</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Read chapter 3 in Core Java.  From here on, don't expect me to
  tell you what to read.  If you can't figure it out...</li>
  <li>Repeat hw01, except in Java.
    <ul>
      <li>Add the ability to take command line arguments.  The
      first argument, if provided should be the number of generations,
      the second, again only if provided, the name of the file to
      run.</li>
      <li>Use the default values from hw01 if command line arguments
      are not provided.  The default file, life.txt, should be assumed
      to be in the "current working directory", probably the directory
      your code is in.</li>
      <li>Write your output to standard output, i.e. "the screen".</li>
      <li>Do <em>not</em> put your code in a package or in a jar file.
      I assume if you do so, either you know more Java than you should
      if you are in this class, or you are totally dependent of an IDE
      that is packaging it all for you.  If you are doing that, then
      you are likely not learning very much.  When I want you to put
      code in either packages or jar files, I will tell you.</li>
      <li>We have introduced all the API that you need.  The various
      classes covered in the readings and in the slides.  If you are
      using other classes, I expect that you have not been paying
      attention.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Remember:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>First, let me say I know all these points will seem obvious
      to most anyone who has written code in almost any language, but
      still some students manage to surprise me.  So, please be sure
      to pay attention to the following for this and future
      assignments.</li>
      <li>Use <em>good</em> names.  Do <em>not</em> use single letter
      names.  Ok, i and j for loop variables.  Maybe x and y for
      coordinates in a 2D space.  But that's about it.</li>
      <li><em>Remember</em> Java's naming conventions.</li>
      <li>Make good use of functions.  Writing this entire program as
      a single function is a bad idea.</li>
      <li>Provide reasonable comments</li>
      <li>Use proper indentation.  If you are using a decent editor,
      such as emacs, you editor should easily help you with
      indentation.</li>
      <li>Always write clean, readable code.</li>
      <li>You are writing Java code, the files should be .java files.
      Not .txt.  And certainly not .docx!  (Yes, someone once really
      did submit a Word file.)</li>
      <li><em>All</em> fields must be private.  If all of your
      variables are "local" then you won't have to worry about this.</li>

      <li>I addressed the issue of where your code should expect the
      default file, life.txt to be.  But speaking more generally, do
      not assume I am using your choice of operating system.  Also, I
      may not want to put my files where you want me to.  In paricular
      do <em>not</em> hardcode absolute paths, such as C:\life.txt.</li>

    </ul>
</ul>
